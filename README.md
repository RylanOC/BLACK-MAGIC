# Tips, Tricks, and Tools from CTFs

CTFs are fun and sometimes I accidentally learn things from them. Here are some of those things.

(I mostly play RE/pwn, so of these notes will probably be about those two categories)



### Pwning

- [Generating Your own libc Leaks](./pwn/puts_puts.md)
- [Easily Call Arbitrary Function Pointers with up to Three Arguments](./pwn/libc_csu_init.md)
- [Abusing the STDIN Buffer (In Progress)](./pwn/stdin_buff.md)

### Reverse Engineering

- [Using Angr to Solve Crackmes (In Progress)](./re/symbolic_execution.md)
- [Using Z3 to Solve Difficult Constraints (In Progress)](./re/constraint_solving.md)
- [Replaying Program Execution with Timeless Debugging (In Progress)](./re/timeless_debugging.md)
